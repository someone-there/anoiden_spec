# Anoiden V1 Spec

Anoiden is an anonymous single sign-on protocol utilizing zero-knowledge proofs.
This protocol enables users to sign in to service providers (SP) while keeping their identity secret, even if the identity provider (IdP) and service provider collude.
It utilizes the [Semaphore](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore).

This repository is a specification for the Anoiden protocol.
It is intended to be a reference for developers who wish to implement the protocol in their services.

## V1
V1 is the first version of the Anoiden protocol.
V1 is not yet finalized and is subject to change.
You can find the latest version of the V1 spec from [here](/V1/spec_en.md)(EN) or [here](/V1/spec_ja.md)(JA).
